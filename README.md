# OpenCV
Playing around with OpenCV in Python

A programme that detects "key points" can be run using main.py. In the example below is some dashcam footage. In the screenshot you can see how various points are highlighted that OpenCV has deemed suitable for tracking. This can then be taken further e.g. autonomous driving vehicles use a similar process in order to monitor their surroundings
